# basic_logic_arithmetic.asm
This is a MASM program that completes the following tasks: 
1) Displays name of developer and program title on output screen.
2) Displays instructions for the user.
3) Prompts user to enter three numbers (A, B, C) in strictly descending order.
4) Calculates and displays the sum and differences of the three numbers (A+B, A-B, A+C, A-C, B+C, B-C, A+B+C).
5) Displays a closing message.

# arrays_addressing_program.asm
This is a MASM program that completes the following tasks:
1) Introduces the program.
2) Declares global constants (ARRAYSIZE, LO, HI), generates random integers in the range from LO to HI (inclusive), and stores them as consecutive elements of an array.
3) Displays the list of integers before sorting. 
4) Sorts the list in ascending order.
5) Calulcates and displays median value of sorted array, rounded to the nearest integer.
6) Displays the sorted array.
7) Generates an array that holds the number of times each value in range LO to HI is seen in the array.
8) Displays the array of counts.
